# me_yo
My (hopefully not futile) attempts to master my beloved craft (^˵◕ω◕˵^)  
I will be sharing educational materials (and beyond), certifications from completed courses, professional recommendations, and other work-related artifacts documenting my journey in data analytics.

## 🌺 About me 🌺
   </div>
   
**Data Analyst with 2.5+ years of experience.** Specializing in process automation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Proficient in SQL, Python, Power BI, VBA, and MS Excel.
My strength: Transforming routine tasks into efficient algorithms — reduced key report generation time by 75%, developed 10+ automation templates, and trained 30+ colleagues in their use.

Participated in large-scale projects: From creating a statistical handbook for OJSC Russian Railways (archival data analysis) to optimizing HR strategies for a state-owned company. I believe even complex tasks can be broken into steps — just start and move forward incrementally.

Work philosophy: Value clear goals and pragmatism. **Dislike "work for work’s sake"** — always seek to improve outcomes through optimization. Currently curating my portfolio in this repository, featuring case studies, experiments with new tools, and automation examples.

Personal: Love dissecting horror movie plots and painting with oils while listening to podcasts. Firmly believe creativity and attention to detail are integral to analytics.

**Don’t wait for perfect conditions — start acting, because you’re the one who creates them.**
