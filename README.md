## 🌺 About me 🌺
   </div>
   
**Data Analyst with 3.5+ years of experience.** My areas of expertise are reporting automation and process modeling. Proficient in SQL, Python, Power BI, MS Excel (VBA, query, pivot), Aris, Sila union, Jupiter, Google Collab and many else.
My strength: 
- transforming routine tasks into efficient algorithms,   
- ability to identify patterns and derive insights from data,    
- solid foundation in process modeling and description,           
- experience managing teams of up to 5 people,            
- cross-disciplinary perspective,              
- proactivity and a sense of ownership.

Participated in large-scale projects: From creating a statistical handbook for OJSC Russian Railways (archival data analysis) to optimizing HR strategies for a state-owned company. I believe even complex tasks can be broken into steps — just start and move forward incrementally.

Work philosophy: Value clear goals and pragmatism. **Dislike "work for work’s sake"** — always seek to improve outcomes through optimization. Currently curating my portfolio in this repository, featuring case studies, experiments with new tools, and automation examples.

Personal: Love dissecting horror movie plots and painting with oils while listening to podcasts. Firmly believe creativity and attention to detail are integral to analytics.

**Don’t wait for perfect conditions — start acting, because you’re the one who creates them.**
