Work philosophy: **Dislike "work for work’s sake"** — always seek to improve outcomes through optimization. 

Personal: I'm a highly energetic (sometimes excessively so!) and proactive person. I love tasks that demand creativity and truly enjoy building entirely new solutions from the ground up.

**Don’t wait for perfect conditions — start acting, because you’re the one who creates them.**
