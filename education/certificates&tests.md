**This section showcases the educational programs, professional development courses, and specialized training I have completed in preparation for a career in data analysis.**

At first glance, the number of courses may appear excessive. However, this is a reflection of deliberate necessity: lacking a formal foundational education in this field, I adopted a systematic approach to building both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.     

Each course was intentionally selected as a step in bridging knowledge gaps—progressing from core statistics and data handling to advanced machine learning techniques. This structured, phased approach was designed to establish a robust foundation for ongoing professional development, which accounts for the diversity of programs listed here.      

Such a learning framework not only helped offset the absence of an academic background in data science but also cultivated an interdisciplinary perspective for solving analytical challenges.

jul/30/2024 - The course provided structured knowledge in data analysis: I mastered SQL, Tableau, R, and practiced data cleaning and visualization. The hands-on assignments, especially the final case study, helped solidify my skills. The downside is that some topics were covered superficially (e.g., machine learning), but it’s a decent starting point. Plus, it was good language practice, naturally. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn for free.
