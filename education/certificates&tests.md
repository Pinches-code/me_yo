**This section showcases the educational programs, professional development courses, and specialized training I have completed in preparation for a career in data analysis.**

At first glance, the number of courses may appear excessive. However, this is a reflection of deliberate necessity: lacking a formal foundational education in this field, I adopted a systematic approach to building both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.     

Each course was intentionally selected as a step in bridging knowledge gapsâ€”progressing from core statistics and data handling to advanced machine learning techniques. This structured, phased approach was designed to establish a robust foundation for ongoing professional development, which accounts for the diversity of programs listed here.      

Such a learning framework not only helped offset the absence of an academic background in data science but also cultivated an interdisciplinary perspective for solving analytical challenges.
