**This section showcases the educational programs, professional development courses, and specialized training I have completed in preparation for a career in data analysis.**

At first glance, the number of courses may appear excessive. However, this is a reflection of deliberate necessity: lacking a formal foundational education in this field (at the time), I adopted a systematic approach to building both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.     

Each course was intentionally selected as a step in bridging knowledge gaps—progressing from core statistics and data handling to advanced machine learning techniques. This structured, phased approach was designed to establish a robust foundation for ongoing professional development, which accounts for the diversity of programs listed here.      

Such a learning framework not only helped offset the absence of an academic background in data science but also cultivated an interdisciplinary perspective for solving analytical challenges.

Aaand here we go!

jan/2025 - The course provided a solid foundation: I mastered Python syntax, working with collections, functions (including generators and decorators), OOP (object-oriented programming), and core modules (file handling, datetime). Hands-on practice with real projects helped automate routine tasks and write clean code — from simple scripts to mini-applications. Pros: free format with flexible scheduling, automated assignment checks, and access to mentors for guidance. The downside is the superficial coverage of advanced topics (e.g., metaclasses were not covered), but it’s enough to get started.

nov/2024 - The hackathon sharpened my algorithmic thinking skills: I tackled problems involving graphs, code optimization, and probabilistic calculations. The semifinal practice taught me to analyze requirements swiftly and test solutions; the task on minimizing base station connections via sum parity stood out as particularly memorable.

sep/22/2024 - The course helped me master creating charters, roadmaps, risk management, and Agile methodologies. Hands-on practice with real-world cases (budgeting, stakeholder communication) taught me to document processes in Asana and Jira. The downside is the limited in-depth KPI analysis, but it’s sufficient for a foundational level.

sep/03/2024 - The course boosted my skills in Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and Cognos — I now confidently clean data, build dashboards, and perform ETL. I loved the project-based approach: real-world cases with business requests (sales analysis, Jupyter visualizations) were added straight to my portfolio. The downside is the basic coverage of statistics and machine learning, but it was sufficient for analytics. The clear guidelines for preparing reports and presentations were also very helpful.

jul/30/2024 - The course provided structured knowledge in data analysis: I mastered SQL, Tableau, R, and practiced data cleaning and visualization. The hands-on assignments, especially the final case study, helped solidify my skills. The downside is that some topics were covered superficially (e.g., machine learning), but it’s a decent starting point. Plus, it was good language practice, naturally. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn for free.

jul/21/2024 - The course provided an in-depth understanding of ML: from linear regression to neural networks (TensorFlow, Keras). Real-world projects (image recognition, text processing) taught me to build and optimize models. A major plus was the focus on mathematics (gradient descent, backpropagation) without fluff. The downside is that challenging assignments require prior basic knowledge of Python and linear algebra. The course helped me systematize my knowledge for working with advanced algorithms.

apr/05/2024 - I learned to structure resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems), write achievement-focused cover letters, practice STAR-method interviews, and negotiate in English. Practice with simulations (mock interviews, case study breakdowns) and LinkedIn templates boosted my confidence. A major plus was the focus on cultural nuances (e.g., how to present experience for US/EU companies). The downside is the limited in-depth grammar coverage, but it was sufficient for career goals.
